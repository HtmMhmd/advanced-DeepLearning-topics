    "## Extension Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "To further develop these materials:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visualization components**: Add visualizations showing how embeddings cluster\n",
    "2. **Performance comparisons**: Benchmark the different implementations\n",
    "3. **Integration with real services**: Connect to actual OpenAI API or other LLMs\n",
    "4. **User interface**: Develop a simple web interface for the RAG system\n",
    "5. **Real-world challenges**: Add materials about handling edge cases, large documents, etc.\n",

    "## From Learning to Application\n",
    "\n",
    "These teaching materials are designed to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. By seeing the same system implemented at three different levels, students can understand how their knowledge and skills can progress from basic concepts to professional-grade code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG system is an excellent example for teaching because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It combines multiple modern technologies (PDF processing, embeddings, LLMs)\n",
    "2. It has clear, separable components for modular learning\n",
    "3. It demonstrates practical AI application students can relate to\n",
    "4. It scales from simple to complex implementations naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjust the pace based on your students' background\n",
    "- Use the real RAG-pdf codebase for advanced students wanting to see a full implementation\n",
    "- Encourage students to develop their own variations and extensions\n",
    "- Connect concepts to current industry practices in AI and software development\n",
